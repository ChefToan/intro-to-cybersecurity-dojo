This level explores trade-offs between adding just a bit of complexity to a software feature (in this case, the cIMG sprite functionality) and its resulting functionality improvement (making the cIMG file smaller!).
We might be getting close to optimal cIMG sizes here, and `/challenge/cimg` will be very demanding!
