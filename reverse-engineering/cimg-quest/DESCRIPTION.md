You thought cimg was just for neat challenges and dank memes?
Think again!
Welcome to The Epic Quest for the Flag, the first cimg video game.
Can you uncover the flag?

Note, `/challenge/quest` uses `cimg` as a graphics engine, but it's built for a custom version of `cimg` that you do not have.
You run it with `/challenge/quest NOFLAG | /challenge/cimg` to run it in "compatibility mode": no flag, but compatible with the standard `cimg`.
If you want the flag, you'll need to modify the `cimg` to work with the `quest`, and run it via `/challenge/quest | /home/hacker/your-patched-cimg`.

**HINT:**
You can either patch using your reverse engineering tool of choice or figure out the file address of the bytes you want to patch and use `hexedit`.
