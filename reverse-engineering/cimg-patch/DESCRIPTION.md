Support for different operations allow fairly advanced cIMG functionality.
For example, you previously created the images you needed by specifying all of the pixels explicitly.
However, with the advanced functionality added in this level, that is no longer necessary!
Consequently, the challenge will not give you the flag if you use too many bytes to make the right image.
Good luck.
