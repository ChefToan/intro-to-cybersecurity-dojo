Often times, as feature bloat makes a software project more and more complicated, vulnerabilities slip in due to the interaction of too many moving parts.
In the course of reverse engineering the software, reverse engineers will often spot such vulnerabilities.

This is one such scenario.
Find and use the vulnerability in `/challenge/cimg` to get the flag!
