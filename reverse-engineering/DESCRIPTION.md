Welcome to your introduction to Reverse Engineering!
Reverse Engineering is a critial art that you will evolve during your journey through pwn.college, and this journey starts here with the Connor Image Format, cIMG.
You have never heard of cIMG before, and it does not actually exist in the wider world, but throughout this module you will _reverse engineer_ it by analyzing various iterations of cIMG rendering binaries.
By the time you solve the last level, you will have gone from no knowledge about cIMG to complete understanding of it, a path that you will walk many times with many different programs.
