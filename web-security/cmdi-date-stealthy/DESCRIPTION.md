Sometimes, you must carefully craft your command injection so as to not break the original command!
For example, if the original command fails, the server you are exploiting might crash in a way that interferes with your goals.
You experienced this in the previous level in terms of needing to keep the shell command itself valid, but sometimes you must keep valid output!

This level will explore this scenario.
Remember: there are many ways to command-inject, and typically, where you can inject one special character, you can inject many more.
Good luck!
