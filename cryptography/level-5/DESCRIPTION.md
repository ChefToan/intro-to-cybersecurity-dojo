In this challenge you will decrypt a secret encrypted with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
The Electronic Codebook (ECB) block cipher mode of operation is used.
You can encrypt arbitrary data, which has the secret appended to it, with the key being reused each time.

This level is quite a step up in difficulty (and future levels currently do not build on this level), so if you are completely stuck feel free to move ahead.
