In this challenge you will decrypt a secret encrypted with a one-time pad.  
Although simple, this is the most secure encryption mechanism, if a) you can securely transfer the key and b) you only ever use the pad _once_ per message.
It's also the most simple encryption mechanism: you simply _XOR_ the bits of the plaintext with the bits of the key one by one!
