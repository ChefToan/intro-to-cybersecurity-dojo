description: Solve various cryptography challenges ranging from decoding base64 data to performing a simplified TLS handshake.
challenges:
- id: level-1
  name: base64
- id: level-2
  name: One Time Pad
- id: level-3
  name: Many Time Pad
- id: level-4
  name: level4
  description: Decrypt a secret encrypted with AES using the ECB mode of operation
- id: level-5
  name: level5
  description: Decrypt a secret encrypted with AES-ECB, where arbitrary data is appended to the secret and the key is reused. This level is quite a step up in difficulty (and future levels currently do not build on this level), so if you are completely stuck feel free to move ahead. Check out [this lecture video](https://youtu.be/YO5bgKjqW00?t=1901) on how to approach level 5.
- id: level-6
  name: level6
  description: Perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish a shared secret
- id: level-7
  name: level7
  description: Decrypt an RSA-encrypted secret using provided public and private keys
- id: level-8
  name: level8
  description: Decrypt an RSA-encrypted secret using the provided prime factors of n
- id: level-9
  name: level9
  description: Find a small hash collision using SHA256, considering only the first 2 bytes
- id: level-10
  name: level10
  description: Compute a small proof-of-work by appending response data to the challenge data, resulting in a SHA256 hash with 2 null-bytes
- id: level-11
  name: level11
  description: Complete an RSA challenge-response using provided public and private keys
- id: level-12
  name: level12
  description: Complete an RSA challenge-response by providing the public key
